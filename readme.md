Paste_Anywhere is a simple utility that allows you to paste code anywhere (Made for use with Turbo C++)

## Why Paste_Anywhere
Paste_Anywhere was made because I had to use Borland's Turbo C++ in 2022, and I wanted to write my code in a better, more featureful IDE. But I couldn't paste the code that I had written in VSCode into Turbo C++. So I made this simple program that allows me to paste code into Turbo C++ by pressing Ctrl+Shift+V.

_Paste Anywhere_ can be used by engineering students across the country, whoever has to use Turbo C++ in their class.

## How to Use
1. Run Paste_Anywhere.exe (It will run in the background)
2. Open VSCode and type your code in it.
3. Copy your code by selecting all of it with `Ctrl+A` and copy it using `Ctrl+C`.
4. Open Turbo C++.
5. âœ¨Paste your code using **`Ctrl+Shift+V`.**
