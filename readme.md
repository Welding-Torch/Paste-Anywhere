Paste_Anywhere is a simple utility that allows you to paste code anywhere (Made for use with Turbo C++)

## Why Paste_Anywhere
Paste_Anywhere was made because I had to use Borland's Turbo C++ in 2022, and I wanted to write my code in a better, more featureful IDE. But I couldn't paste the code that I had written in VSCode into Turbo C++. So I made this simple program that allows me to paste code into Turbo C++ by pressing Ctrl+Shift+V.
